Finished building my enviroment.
Settled on windows 10.
Got Claude running on WSL.
Allowed Claude to connect to Ubuntu server VMS via ssh with the following commands: 


ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

ssh-copy-id username@server-ip-address

to allow claude to run commands as sudo allow passwordless sudo with the command:

To enable passwordless sudo (run this now on your server):
  echo "tom ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/tom

  To disable it later (after installation is complete):
  sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/tom
N8N is set up in docker container accessable via http://192.168.1.192:5678/

Played around with my first AI agent from the beginner page of n8n:
